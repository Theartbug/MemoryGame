# MemoryGame

A game to test my concepts: css selectors / animation, control flow for loops, if/else statements. Not meant for mobile.

1. Create cards programmatically for different levels.
2. Animate cards to flip when clicked, light up when matched, and board game fade away when game ends.
3. Create a timer that can accept different input in seconds and parse into minutes / seconds that counts down.
4. Create a score system that rewards each match, subtracts each mis-flip, and add left over time.
5. Create a best score system using local storage.
